            <h2>Where to stay</h2>
            <div>
            <p>The hotels near the Phoenix Convention Center will all be ok. The surrounding areas can be a little iffy, so please read reviews. You also want a hotel which mentions “access to the light rail.” If you’re staying in a hotel off the light rail, you can take the light rail from the airport to your hotel, and also from the hotel to the wedding location (Phoenix Art Museum) and rehearsal gathering (Phoenix First Friday).</p>
            <p>If you prefer to save money on a hotel, but spend money on a rental car, anywhere in Chandler is good, but you will be 30 minutes by car away from the wedding venues and weekend activities, so you'll likely need to rent a car. That being said, Uber is available!</p>
            <p>For anyone who has questions about a specific hotel they are considering, please email Paul directly at paulnakata at gmail dot com. Paul and I will probably be staying at the Westin Phoenix Downtown, The Hyatt Regency Phoenix or Hilton Garden Inn Phoenix Downtown. A little off the beaten path is the Clarendon Hotel, which is a super cool place we are also considering. If you are looking to Airbnb, we recommend looking for access to the light rail and reading the reviews.</p>
